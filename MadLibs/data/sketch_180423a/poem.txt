If I could <verb> your arms tonight-
But half the <noun> and the broken sea
Lie between you and <noun>.

The autumn rain <noun> in the courtyard,
<adjective> all night against the coarse stone,
The sound of useless <noun> in the <adjective> courtyard
Makes me <adjective> alone.

If <noun> were here, if you were only here-
My blood <verb> out to you all night in vain
As <adjective> as the rain.
